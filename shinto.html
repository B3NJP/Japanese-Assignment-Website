        <p>
          Shinto originated in Japan, it is the belief that everything as “Kami” or spirit, which can also be translated into God, everything in nature has a sprit, such as rivers, trees, rocks, the sun, and the weather. There are also many festivals and ceremonies in Shinto, the oldest recorded ritual is Niinamesai, where the Emperor offers the newly harvested rice to the kami for their blessing of a bountiful harvest. There are also Shinto Shrines, where one can offer prayer to the kami.
