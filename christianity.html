      <h2>General</h2>
      <p>
        Christianity holds only a small percentage (2.3%) of the Japanese population. There are around 2.94 million Christians living in Japan. Many holidays that hold Christian roots are celebrated in Japan (Christmas, Valentine’s).

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          Christianity first entered Japan in 1542, when Japanese lords on Kyushu accepted Portuguese sailors for the weapons they brought. Naturally, they also had to accept the Jesuit missionaries that came with them.

  In 1587, Toyotomi Hideyoshi banned Christian Missionaries from entering the country due to a number of issues. By 1641, Christianity was completely banned and the Portuguese were replaced by the Dutch who didn’t send out missionaries. It wasn’t until the Meiji Restoration (1868) that freedom of religion began again. With that, the number of Japanese Christians has started increasing.

        <h2>Traditions</h2>
        <p>
          Some of the Christian traditions have become popular among the Japanese population. Good examples would be Valentine’s Day and Christmas. As with many countries, these traditions have had the religious parts (going to church on Christmas day, etc) unpracticed by the non-Christian population. It is to note that, while Valentine’s Day and Christmas are celebrated by the general populace, they are not national holidays. Another thing to note would be that many other traditions (for example Easter) are not celebrated by the general population.
